Tutorial about sentiment analysis in python
===========================================

In this tutorial I use python and the libraries
* scikit-learn
* pandas

to build a basic sentiment analysis machine learning model

I needed to compress the data-file since it was to big to upload it to github.
Please unpack the file into the data folder to get the script working without any changes.
